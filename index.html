  The <cite>Network Information API</cite> enables web applications to access information about the network connection
  in use by the device.
</section>

<section id='sotd'></section>

## Introduction and background

More and more devices are permanently connected to the Internet, and connectivity is a fundamental requirement for many.
Network connectivity depends on a lot of factors, some of which include the connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, 5G,
etc.),
but also factors like the device's physical location (e.g., Wi-Fi on a moving train), or the user's preferences (e.g., a
desire
to not overly tax a data connection shared with others).

Naive assumptions like "connected to Wi-Fi always means connectivity is granted and data is cheap" or the opposite
"connected to cellular always means connectivity is spotty and data is expensive" no longer hold true, and in many cases
never did.

The <cite>Network Information API</cite> aims to provide a standard approach for web applications to query the current
network
status
in a meaningful and privacy-preserving way.

### Distinction from the save data use case

Getting information about the network connection is not to be treated as equivalent to a necessary desire to save data.
For example, a web application that downloads data via the BitTorrent protocol may voluntarily want to limit itself to
only a percentage of the available bandwidth.

## Definitions

### Metered connection

A <cite>metered connection</cite> is an Internet connection that has a data limit associated with it. Examples include
mobile data
plans with a certain amount of included data,
but also ad-hoc hotel Wi-Fi access, or even certain home Internet data plans. Once the data limit is reached, the
connection is
interrupted,
or continuous data usage is charged at an additional (commonly high) cost.
It is typically the desire of the user to remain within the caps of the data plan, and not be charged for data usage
above the cap.

### Effective connection type

The <cite>effective connection type</cite> is a numerical means to express what kind of transfers the current
connection is suitable for. [Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/)
has shown that users'
bandwidth grows by 50% per year. Therefore, rather than use fixed speed labels like 3G, 4G, or 5G (that might be based
on theoretically technically possible maximum bandwidth or field-measured actual bandwidth) or meaningless
labels like Wi-Fi, the <cite>Network Information API</cite>
uses open-ended bandwidth ranges to express the effective connection type.
These ranges are measured in bit per second (bit/s) and can be used in conjunction with SI prefixes (e.g.,
1&nbsp;kbit/s&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;bit/s,
1&nbsp;Mbit/s&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;kbit/s, 1&nbsp;Gbit/s&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;Mbit/s, or
1&nbsp;Tbit/s&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;Gbit/s).
For example, 4K&nbsp;video commonly requires 20&nbsp;Mbp/s sustained speed according to the popular streaming service
[YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/78358?hl=en).

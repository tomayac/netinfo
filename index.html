  The <cite>Network Information API</cite> enables web applications to access information about
  the network connection in use by the device.
</section>

<section id="sotd"></section>

## Introduction and background

More and more devices are permanently connected to the Internet, and connectivity is a
fundamental requirement for many. Network connectivity depends on a lot of factors, some of
which include the connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, 5G, etc.), but also factors like the
device's physical location (e.g., Wi-Fi on a moving train), or the user's preferences (e.g., a
desire to not overly tax a data connection shared with others). Naive assumptions like
"connected to Wi-Fi always means connectivity is granted and data is cheap" or the opposite
"connected to cellular always means connectivity is spotty and data is expensive" no longer hold
true, and in many cases never did. The <cite>Network Information API</cite> aims to provide a
standard approach for web applications to query the current network status in a meaningful and
privacy-preserving way.

### Distinction from the save data use case

Getting information about the
<dfn>network connection</dfn> is not to be treated as equivalent to a necessary desire to save
data. For example, a web application that downloads data via the BitTorrent protocol may
voluntarily want to limit itself to only a percentage of the available bandwidth as to not block
other browsing activity, but the objective is not saving data. The save data use case is
described in [[SAVE-DATA]]. Web developers can also make use of the
[<code>prefers-reduced-data</code>](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#prefers-reduced-data) user
preference media feature in CSS (<code>@media (prefers-reduced-data: reduce) { /*…*/ }</code>) or
JavaScript (<code>if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-data: reduce)').matches) { /*…*/ }</code>).
[[MEDIA-QUERIES]]

## Definitions

### Metered connection

A <dfn>metered connection</dfn> is an Internet connection that has a data limit associated with
it. Examples include mobile data plans with a certain amount of included data, but also ad-hoc
hotel Wi-Fi access, or even certain home Internet data plans. Once the data limit is reached,
the connection is interrupted, or continuous data usage is charged at an additional (commonly
high) cost. It is typically the desire of the user to remain within the caps of the data plan,
and not be charged for data usage above the cap.
This signal is up to the user and/or operating system to provide. It is not an indication of
any particular level of metering.

### Sustained connection speed

The <dfn>sustained connection speed</dfn> is a numerical means to express what kind of transfers
the current connection is suitable for. [Nielsen's Law of Internet
Bandwidth](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/) has shown that users' bandwidth
grows by 50% per year. Therefore, rather than use fixed speed labels like 3G, 4G, or 5G (that
might be based on theoretically technically possible maximum bandwidth or field-measured actual
bandwidth) or meaningless labels like Wi-Fi, the <cite>Network Information API</cite> uses
open-ended bandwidth ranges to express the sustained connection speed. These ranges are measured
in <dfn data-lt="BitPerSecond">bit per second</dfn> (bit/s) and can be used in conjunction with
SI prefixes (e.g., 1&nbsp;kbit/s&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;bit/s,
1&nbsp;Mbit/s&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;kbit/s, 1&nbsp;Gbit/s&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;Mbit/s, or
1&nbsp;Tbit/s&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;Gbit/s). For example, 4K&nbsp;video commonly requires
20&nbsp;Mbp/s sustained speed according to the popular streaming service
[YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/78358?hl=en). The means through which the
sustained connection speed is realized (e.g., via a Wi-Fi or an ethernet connection) is not
exposed.

## Use cases

Depending on the dynamically obtained network connection information, pages can:

- Instead of Retina resolution images use "regular" resolution images.
- Reduce the quality of lossy compressed images.
- Disable autoplay for foreground videos.
- Replace background videos with poster images.
- Request fewer or more results from a search API.

## The <dfn>NavigatorNetworkInformation</dfn> interface

The <code><dfn data-cite="!HTML#navigator">Navigator</dfn></code> and
<code><dfn data-cite="!HTML#workernavigator">WorkerNavigator</dfn></code>
interface expose access to the <a>NetworkInformation</a> interface by mixing in
<a>NavigatorNetworkInformation</a>.

<pre class="idl">
  interface mixin NavigatorNetworkInformation {
    [SameObject] readonly attribute NetworkInformation connection;
  };

  Navigator includes NavigatorNetworkInformation;
  WorkerNavigator includes NavigatorNetworkInformation;
</pre>

### The <code><dfn>connection</dfn></code> attribute

The <a>connection</a> attribute, when getting, returns an object that implements the
<a>NetworkInformation</a>
interface.

## The <dfn>NetworkInformation</dfn> interface

The <a>NetworkInformation</a> interface provides a means to access information about the
network connection the user agent is currently using. The
<code><dfn data-cite="DOM#interface-eventtarget">EventTarget</dfn></code> is defined in
[[!DOM]].

<pre data-cite="HTML" class="idl">
  [Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
  interface NetworkInformation : EventTarget {
    readonly attribute boolean metered;
    readonly attribute BitPerSecond sustainedSpeed;
    attribute EventHandler onchange;
  };

  typedef unrestricted double BitPerSecond;
</pre>

### The <code><dfn>metered</dfn></code> attribute

The <a>metered</a> attribute, when getting, returns whether the connection that the the user
agent is using is a <a>metered connection</a>. This information is commonly known to the
operating system and can be relayed to the user agent as is.
User agents may offer an override mechanism at their own discretion.

#### The <code><dfn>Sec-CH-Metered-Connection</dfn></code> request header field

The <a><code>Sec-CH-Metered-Connection</code></a> request header field is a boolean that indicates whether
the connection that the user agent is using is a <a>metered connection</a> at the time when
the request is made by the user agent. It is a Structured Header whose value must be a
Boolean. [[STRUCTURED-HEADERS]]

### The <dfn><code>sustainedSpeed</code></dfn> attribute

The <a>sustainedSpeed</a> attribute, when getting, returns the
<a>sustained connection speed</a> in <a>bit per second</a> that is determined by the user
agent using a combination of recently observed <dfn>round trip time</dfn> and
<dfn>downlink</dfn> values. This information is commonly known to the operating system and
can be relayed to the user agent as is. User agents can, at their own discretion, look back at a
sliding window of recent observations and put the observed connection speeds in buckets of
exponentially growing size of bits per second ranges.

#### The <code><dfn>Sec-CH-Sustained-Speed</dfn></code> request header field

The <a><code>Sec-CH-Sustained-Speed</code></a> request header field is a token that indicates the
<a>sustainedSpeed</a> at the time when the request is made by the user agent. It is a
Structured Header whose value must be a Token. [[STRUCTURED-HEADERS]]

### The <code><dfn>onchange</dfn></code> attribute

The <a>onchange</a> event handler attribute handles "change" events fired during the
<a>steps to update the connection values</a>.

#### Handling changes to the underlying connection

When the properties of the
<a>network connection</a> change, the user agent MUST run the
<dfn>steps to update the connection values</dfn>:

  1. Let <var>new-metered</var> be the new <a>metered connection</a> value.
  1. Let <var>new-sustained-speed</var> be the new bucket for the new <a>sustained connection speed</a>.
  1. If <var>new-metered</var> is different from the previous `connection.metered` value,
     or if <var>new-sustained-speed</var> is in a different bucket than `connection.sustainedSpeed`:
     1. Using the <a data-cite="!HTML#networking-task-source">networking task source</a>, <a data-cite="!HTML#queue-a-task">queue a task</a> to perform the following:
        1. Set `connection.metered` to <var>new-metered</var>.
        1. Set `connection.sustainedSpeed` to <var>new-sustained-speed</var>.
        1. <a data-cite="!DOM#concept-event-fire">Fire an event</a> named `change` at the `NetworkInformation` object.

## Privacy Considerations

Knowing whether a connection is metered adds a low entropy signal to the user agent.
Since both mobile and desktop connections can be marked as metered, having this information
is not enough to determine whether a user is on a cellular, Ethernet, or Wi-Fi connection.

Pages can measure the sustained connection speed by requesting files of a known size from
multiple remote servers and measuring the time until the downloads finish. The same information
is made available in more granular form as buckets of exponentially growing size of bit per second ranges.
User agents can size these buckets arbitrarily, or in the extreme case report infinity or zero.
By making the sustained connection speed available at request time via client hint adds
a low entropy signal to the user agent.

The privacy considerations of [[CLIENT-HINTS]] likewise apply to the headers defined by this specification.

## Examples of usage

### Downloading non-essential content

<pre class="example js">
  <code>
    let nonEssentialContentLoaded = false;

    async function downloadNonEssentialContent() {
      if (nonEssentialContentLoaded) {
        return;
      }
      if (!navigator.connection.metered) {
        await fetch('https://example.com/non-essential-content/');
        nonEssentialContentLoaded = true;
      }
    }

    if (!navigator.connection.metered) {
      downloadNonEssentialContent();
    }

    navigator.connection.addEventListener('change', downloadNonEssentialContent);
  </code>
</pre>

### Limiting bandwidth usage

<pre class="example js">
  <code>
    const initialSustainedSpeedInBytes = navigator.connection.sustainedSpeed / 8;

    // https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent/blob/master/docs/api.md#client--new-webtorrentopts
    const client = new WebTorrent({
      // Max 50% of the available bandwidth.
      downLimit = 0.5 * initialSustainedSpeedInBytes,
    });

    navigator.connection.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
      const currentSustainedSpeedInBytes = event.connection.sustainedSpeed / 8;
      // https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent/blob/master/docs/api.md#clientthrottledownloadrate
      client.throttleDownload(0.5 * currentSustainedSpeedInBytes);
    });
  </code>
</pre>

### Adaptive loading based on client hints

1. The client makes an initial request to the server.
   ```bash
   GET / HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   ```
1. The server responds, telling the client via `Accept-CH` that it accepts the `Sec-CH-Metered-Connection`
   and the `Sec-CH-Sustained-Speed` client hints, and that it also varies the response on the former,
   as conveyed by `Vary`.
   ```bash
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Accept-CH: Sec-CH-Metered-Connection, Sec-CH-Sustained-Speed
   Vary: Sec-CH-Metered-Connection
   ```
1. The client then later makes a follow-up request for `/list-of-products`, telling the server via
   `Sec-CH-Metered-Connection` that it is on a metered connection and via `Sec-CH-Sustained-Speed`
   that its sustained speed is in the bucket of 50,000,000 bps (50 Mbps).
   ```bash
   GET /list-of-products HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Sec-CH-Metered-Connection: 1
   Sec-CH-Sustained-Speed: 50000000
   ```
1. The server can then tailor the response to the client's preferences accordingly and, respecting
   the metered connection, for example, choose to not return all possible products, but just a subset.
   Since the connection speed permits it, the server can choose to include product videos in the response,
   but not autoplay them, because the connection is metered.
